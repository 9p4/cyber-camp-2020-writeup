## Solution

After extracting the file, we are left with a pcap file. To open this file, we need a program called "wireshark". Opening the program in wireshark and looking through the data gives us two requests of interest with the followin data in it:

```

Decoding the first line of hex code gives us a password: `SecurePa55word8!`, which we will need to decode the next hex line. The next hex line is a 7z file. We know this by putting the line into CyberChef. Saving the output to `enc.7z` will allow us to decrypt the file. By running the command `7z x enc.7z` on Linux and typing in the password, we get the flag.

Flag: `capturing_clouds_and_keys`
