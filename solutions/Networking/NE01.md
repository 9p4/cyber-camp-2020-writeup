Basically, to me, "the PCMan's FTP Server 2.0.7" service looked the most sketch, so I looked up the list of exploits for that on [this page](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13318/product_id-27651/version_id-165587/Pcman-s-Ftp-Server-Project-Pcman-s-Ftp-Server-2.0.7.html).  The exploit w the highest rating (10.0) is CVE-2013-4730, which is the flag.

Flag: `CVE-2013-4730`
