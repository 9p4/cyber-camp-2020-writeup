## Solution

Downloading and extracting the zip gives us a file called `fe04.gif`. Looking at this file, the flag flashes in red for a brief amount of time. We need to pause the GIF. I converted it to an MP4 with `ffmpeg -i fe04.gif fe04.mp4` and paused it at the right time.

Flag: `splitting_gifs_like_door_frames`
