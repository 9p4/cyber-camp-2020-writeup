## Solution

Downloading and extracting the program gives us a binary file, which we can run (preferably in a VM). Running it asks us for a password. We can get the password by looking at the strings in the binary with the command `strings program`. Scrolling through it gives us "h0w\_long-is-A\_pi3ce\_ofStr1ng". This is not the flag, but the password. Running the program with the correct password gives us the flag.

Flag: `notStr1ngTh3ory`
