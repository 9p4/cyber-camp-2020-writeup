## Solution

Looking at the source code of the website, we see that there are two SVGs, but only one is showing up. We can view the second SVG by inspecting the code, saving the SVG to a file, and opening it with a SVG viewer. The captcha asks us for two words, and the second word is "fish". By typing in the two words "morning fish" into the text box, we get the flag.

Flag: `css_is_hard`
