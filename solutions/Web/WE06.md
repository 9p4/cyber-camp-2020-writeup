## Solution

Open the website, and open up Inspect Element. Looking at the code, we see that there is a hidden div. We can unhide this by removing the `style="display: none"` in the line. Next, we look at the script line and see that it is on a timer to run after 10000 milliseconds (100 seconds). We can either wait 100 seconds, or we can just copy paste the Javascript into the console and set the delay to 0. By doing this, we get the flag hidden behind the cards.
