## Solution

Using netcat to connect into the machine gives us a prompt to solve something that is much to fast for us to type in. So we can do file redirection. The first question is 36 * 36 + 41, so solving that gives us 1337. Putting that into a file (such as answers.txt) and we can place the contents of the file into netcat using redirection: `nc cgames-nm02.allyourbases.co 9010 < answers.txt`. The second question is 1080 / 360, which we can also put the answer (3) into the file and rerun the command and get the flag.

Flag: `SuperServer1337`
