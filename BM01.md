## Solution

Downloading and extracting the program gives us a binary file, which we can run (preferably in a VM). Running it asks us for a name. Trying our name, we get "Hey name, nice to meet you, have a great day". This just reeks of a buffer overflow question, and when we type in a really long string into the input (I used `aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa`), we get the flag.

Flag: `AAAb1^jJdl&(&_;?>*!&~`,$`
