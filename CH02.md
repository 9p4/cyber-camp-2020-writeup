## Solution

After extracting the file, we are given three files, `crypt1.enc`, `plain1.txt`, and `sample.enc`. These files don't seem to be using anything special for encryption, so we can guess that we will need to XOR the files. XOR is a reversible way to encrypt stuff, and works mathematically like so: `a ^ b = c`, and because it's reversible, we can say that `c ^ b = a`. This can be applied to crypto like so: `plain ^ key = encrypted`, and `encrypted ^ key = plain`. We are given enough files to get a key: the decrypted and encrypted samples. Using XOR logic, we can say that `plain1.txt ^ encrypted = key`, but we need a program to do that. Using [this StackExchange answer](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/398481/xor-a-file-against-a-key/398497#398497), I derived the key, and used it again to get the plaintext of the `crypt1.enc` file.
